#The codes in this repository comes from a project in which we assessed new childcare arrangements compared to previous childcare arrangements from which children were excluded (i.e. expulsion or withdrawal).
#The data transformation file shows where I began preparing the data for analysis before handing it over to a colleague for further tranformation. 
#The data analysis file shows where I was testing various approaches to analysis. I was testing whether I should consider consolidating a measure of three scales to a measure of one scale. I did this by finding the correlation between the responses to each scale. I used that information to decide to average the responses across each scale. I proceeded to conduct three t-tests (one for each measure) to assess whether parent/guardian-reported quality and accessibility changed from their children's previous to current arrangements. After that, I performed one-way ANOVAs to determine if controlling for the child's disability status and public assistance receipt made a significant difference in reported quality and accessibility of the childcare arrangements.
